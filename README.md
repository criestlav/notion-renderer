# notion-renderer

## what ?

```bash
npm install notion-renderer --save
```

## why ?

- I was writing some notes and reflections on publishing based on my decade worth of experience in the field
- I stumbled upon Notion
- I thought to make friends with its API using NodeJS, I figured it would make a great refresher
- so I ended up re-inventing one or two wheels

## how ?

```bash
git clone git@github.com:viqueen/notion-renderer.git
cd notion-renderer
nvm use

npm run build
```
